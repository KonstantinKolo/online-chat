A simple, vintage looking chat app. I'll use it for later projects. Also its a project I did as a task for a school organised company project.

⬆️ May not work in the future. The servers are down but the visuals of the site are accessible.

Features of the app:
➡️ Anonymous account creation (no password or email needed, uses cookies instead)
➡️ Infinite ammount of chat rooms
➡️ Chats and active rooms are stored on a server
➡️ Chat rooms can hold an infinite ammount of people
➡️ While in a chat rooms all the user inside it are displayed on a scrollable side menu.
